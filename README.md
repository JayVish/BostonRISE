# BostonRISE
Java Code for the Greedy dense subgraph discovery algorithms. Provide an input file in the form of an adjacency list.
Example:
0 7
1 2 7 8
2 1 3 7 8
3 2 4 5
4 3
5 3 6 8
6 5 7
7 0 1 2 6 8
8 1 2 5 7

For KCliqueTriangle, also supply a file of all triangles in the graph in the format as follows:
0 1 2
4 5 6

Finally, change the name of the file in the BufferedReader input field to match that of your own dataset.
